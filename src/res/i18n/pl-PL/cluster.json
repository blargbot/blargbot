                "description": "In bbtag, even the names of subtags can be dynamic. This can be achieved simply by placing subtags before the first `;` of a subtag. \n e.g. ```\\{user\\{get;~action\\};\\{userid\\}\\}``` If `~action` is set to `name`, then this will run the `username` subtag, if it is set to `avatar` then it will run the `useravatar` subtag, and so on. Because dynamic subtags are by definition not set in stone, it is recommended not to use them, and as such you will receive warnings when editing/creating a tag/cc which contains a dynamic subtag. Your tag will function correctly, however some optimizations employed by bbtag will be unable to run on any such tag."
