### Open-Sourced
blargbot is completely open-source under the [GNU AGPLv3 License](https://github.com/blargbot/blargbot/blob/master/LICENSE.MD). Feel free to take a look and learn how everything works. If you use any of my code in your own project, you are required to credit me. See the license for more details.

### Open To Suggestions
Have a suggestion for the bot? I would be glad to hear it! Found a bug? I'd like to hear that too! You can suggest anything to me using the `suggest` command, by [joining my guild](https://discord.gg/015GVxZxI8rtlJgXF), or by [submitting a ticket](https://github.com/blargbot/blargbot/issues).

## Note
Open-source does not mean portable. blargbot was not built with portability in mind, and a lot of it is dependant on configs, files, and data structures that aren't available on github. The reason it's open-source is so people can look at it's internals and learn how it works; for educational purposes. Hosting it yourself is not supported.

If you're planning on reverse-engineering the bot to host it yourself, I can't say that I'll approve, but I won't stop you either. My requirements include for this include giving me the heads-up and crediting me as the original author. See the license for more details
